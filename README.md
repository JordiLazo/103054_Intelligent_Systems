## Introduction
In this course, the project will be devoted to the development of a simple videogame. In this subject we will address the artificial intelligence of the project. The graphical part of the game will be addressed in the "Computer graphics and multimedia" subject, while the "Embedded and ubicuos systems" will focus on aspects related to computer-human interaction by means of special devices. Hence, it is strongly recommended to follow through the three subjects at the same time, although it is not mandatory.

The topics of the subject are the following:
- T1. Introduction to Intelligent Systems.
- T2. Advanced Search.
- T3. Reinforcement Learning.
- T4. Supervised machine learning with scikit-learn.
- T5. Unsupervised machine learning with scikit-learn.

## Learning objectives
* Implement and evaluate advanced search algorithms.
* Implement and evaluate reinforcement learning algorithms.
* Apply and evaluate supervised learning algorithms in scikit-learn.
* Apply and evaluate unsupervised learning algorithms in scikit-learn.

## Assignment 1
For the first assignment, you have to work on the "PacMan" project. In particular, you must implement the following algorithms:
